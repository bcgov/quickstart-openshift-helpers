# Setting Up a Vanity or Custom URL

## Generating a Request

Ticketing and administrative steps are for the Natural Resources only.  Other ministries will have their own processes.

Steps:
1. Create a certificate signing request (CSR) and private key using `./csr_generator.sh`.
   - This generates both `<DOMAIN>.csr` and `<DOMAIN>.key` files
   - Example: Running `./csr_generator.sh silva.nrs.gov.bc.ca` creates `silva.nrs.gov.bc.ca.csr` and `silva.nrs.gov.bc.ca.key`
2. Create a [JIRA issue](https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa).
3. Provide details, which are glossed over in the script from step 1.
4. Attach the CSR file generated in step 1.
5. Wait, answering questions or following up as necessary.

## Installing the Certificate

These steps should work for any OpenShift (and hopefully Kubernetes!) setup.  Certificates must have already been provided by your ministry's administrators.

### Preparing Certificate Files

After receiving certificates from your administrators (via JIRA response), you need to prepare the files with the correct naming:

**Files you should have received:**
- End-entity certificate (usually in PEM format, may be `.txt`, `.pem`, `.crt`, or `.cert`)
- CA certificate files (typically named like `1-OV TLS CA 2.txt` and `2-Sectigo Public Server Root.txt`)

**Files you already have:**
- `<DOMAIN>.key` - Generated by `csr_generator.sh` (private key)
- `<DOMAIN>.csr` - Generated by `csr_generator.sh` (not needed for installation, but keep for renewals)

**File renaming required:**
1. Copy or rename your end-entity certificate to `<DOMAIN>.cert`
   - Example: If you received a PEM file for `silva.nrs.gov.bc.ca`, rename it to `silva.nrs.gov.bc.ca.cert`
   - Note: The certificate already contains your public key (extracted from the CSR), so the CSR is not needed for installation
2. Copy the intermediate CA certificate to `<DOMAIN>.ca-cert`
   - Use `1-OV TLS CA 2.txt` (the certificate that directly issued your end-entity certificate)
   - Example: `cp "1-OV TLS CA 2.txt" "silva.nrs.gov.bc.ca.ca-cert"`
   - If validation fails, you may need to concatenate both intermediate CA files:
     ```bash
     cat "1-OV TLS CA 2.txt" "2-Sectigo Public Server Root.txt" > "silva.nrs.gov.bc.ca.ca-cert"
     ```

**Files required for installation:**
- `<DOMAIN>.cert` - End-entity certificate (contains public key, identity, and CA signature)
- `<DOMAIN>.key` - Private key (matches the public key in the certificate)
- `<DOMAIN>.ca-cert` - CA certificate chain (for validation)

**Note:** The CSR file is not used during installation. It's only needed when requesting the certificate from the CA. However, you should retain the CSR and key files for future certificate renewals.

### Installation Steps

1. Ensure all required files are prepared with correct naming (see above)
2. Login to [OpenShift](https://console.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/k8s/cluster/projects)
3. Switch to the appropriate namespace: `oc project <namespace>`
4. Install the certificate using `./install_cert.sh`

## Reinstall and Renewals

For reinstallation or recovery of deleted OpenShift routes, you need:
- `<DOMAIN>.cert` - End-entity certificate
- `<DOMAIN>.key` - Private key
- `<DOMAIN>.ca-cert` - CA certificate chain

For certificate renewals, you need:
- `<DOMAIN>.csr` - Certificate signing request (or generate a new one)
- `<DOMAIN>.key` - Private key (must match the CSR)

Use `./install_cert.sh` as required for reinstallation or after renewals.
